# The Hobbit Hole
A site for a fictional fantacy restaurant. 

I have always been fond of the love of food Hobbits have in LOTR and wanted to imagine what it would be like if there was a restaurant that served all the different foods of Middle Earth from a Hobbit hole.

Please have a look at the live page:  https://zukurai-kushal.github.io/restaurant-page/
